This class represents a population of individuals, i.e., potential candidate solutions to a given problem. In PaGMO an
individual is determined:

* by a unique ID used to track him across generations and migrations,
* by a chromosome (a decision vector),
* by the fitness of the chromosome as evaluated by a :class:`~pygmo.core.problem` and thus including objectives,
  equality constraints and inequality constraints if present.

std::string population_push_back_docstring()

Adds one decision vector (chromosome) to the population.

Appends a new chromosome x to the population, evaluating its fitness and creating a new unique identifier for the newly
born individual. In case of exceptions, the population will not be altered.

Args:
    x (array or list of doubles): decision vector to be added to the population

Raises:
    ValueError: if the dimension of *x* is inconsistent with the problem dimension or with the dimension of existing
        decision vectors in the population, the calculated fitness vector has a dimension which is inconsistent with the
        fitness dimension of the problem or with the dimension of existing fitness vectors in the population
    TypeError: if *x* cannot be converted to a vector of doubles

Examples:

>>> from numpy import array
>>> pop = population()
>>> pop.push_back([1])
>>> pop.push_back(array([2]))
